It was a good experience to start learning a new thing. GitHub is completely  a new thing for me to learn.
 I first tried to follow the tutorial and created my own account on GitHub.
I learned some new terms, but still these things are a bit unclear to me as I am new to it, so its hard for me to understand it within 1 day.

I published my own web page and learn some new things about google searching.
Looking forward to create some more pages in different languages.
