You can install the setup, or you can fork the file.
**To fork the file:**

In GitHub, the 'fork' feature allows you to create a personal copy of a repository owned by another user or organization. When you fork a repository, you create an independent copy that you can modify and work on without affecting the original repository. Here's an explanation of the use of forking in GitHub:
 Forking is commonly used when contributing to open-source projects hosted on GitHub. If you want to contribute to a project, you can fork the repository and make changes in your forked copy. This allows you to work on the code independently without altering the original repository.
