|**01-06-2023**|*It was a good experience to start learning a new thing. GitHub is completely  a new thing for me to learn. I first tried to follow the tutorial and created my own account on GitHub. I learned some new terms, but still these things are a bit unclear to me as I am new to it, so its hard for me to understand it within day.*|
|**02-06-2023**|*I published my own web page and learn some new things about google searching.Looking forward to create some more pages in different languages.*|
|**03-06-2023**|*When I Pushed every type of file(with .xls, .txt, .md) from my local device to GitHub it gives me some clear understanding of the usage of GitHub; I can show my work to other people across the web.I learn the use of some features that I never cared to use before, while searching something on browser. Moreover, I further understand the some baics for making an effective search on google.
